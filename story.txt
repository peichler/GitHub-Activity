Once upon a time there boy. He grew up loving computer science, but one day tragedy struck.

The boy was working to finish a CS400 project that was due in ten minutes... but his internet went out!

The boy started panicking as the project accounted for a huge portion of his grade. He knocked on his neighbour's doors and asked them for help,
but apparently their wifi had gone out too! Desperate, the boy rushed down to the nearest Starbucks. But sadly, by the time he finished his project
he was way past the submission deadline. He then just bought his favourite coffee and went back home.
